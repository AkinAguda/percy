# Router

Percy provides a route that can be used for deciding which views to render
based on, say, the route that the user has visited in their browser.

Here's an example

```rust
// Imported from crates/percy-router-macro-test/src/book_example.rs

{{#include ../../../../crates/percy-router-macro-test/src/book_example.rs}}
```

This section will dive into how that works.
